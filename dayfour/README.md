## 3. Climbing Stairs
This is one of the most popular coding problems which can be solved using the Dynamic Programming technique. In this problem we gonna find via recursion i.e divide and conquer, you are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. The question is, in how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?  
Note: Given n will be a positive integer. 

**Examples:**

Input: `2`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:
There are two ways to climb to the top.  
1\. 1 step + 1 step  
2\. 2 steps 

 
Input: `3`  
Output: `3`  
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.  
1\. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step  
2\. 1 step + 2 steps  
3\. 2 steps + 1 step. 

Input: `5`  
Output: `8`

## 4. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number  
Problem Statement:  
Simulate predictive text on keypads â€” generate all possible word combinations based on digit inputs, just like T9 on old phones. 

**Examples:**

Input:  
digits =` "23"`  
Output: `["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]`

## 6. Real-Time Scenario: Smart Home Security Optimization  
Problem: A smart home security system needs to determine the maximum value of items that can be monitored without triggering adjacent sensors (which would cause interference). Houses are arranged in a line, and adjacent houses cannot be monitored simultaneously.  

Real-world application: IoT security systems, resource optimization  

**Examples:**

Input: `[100, 200, 300, 400, 500]`
Output: `900`  
Input: `[500, 100, 300, 400, 200] ` 
Output: `1000`  
Input: `[500, 100, 300, 400]`  
Output: `900`  
Input: `[500, 400, 300, 200]`  
Output: `800`
