2. Bike Fleet
There are n bikes at given miles away from the starting mile 0, traveling to reach the mile target.
You are given two integer array position and speed, both of length n, where position[i] is the starting mile of the ith bike and speed[i] is the speed of the ith bike in miles per hour.
A bike cannot pass another bike, but it can catch up and then travel next to it at the speed of the slower bike.
A bike fleet is a bike or bikes driving next to each other. The speed of the bike fleet is the minimum speed of any bike in the fleet.
If a bike catches up to a bike fleet at the mile target, it will still be considered as part of the bike fleet.
Return the number of bike fleets that will arrive at the destination.

A bike fleet is a group of bikes that travel together (a slower bike in front causes a faster bike behind to merge into a fleet).

Example 1:
Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The bikes starting at 10 (speed 2) and 8 (speed 4) become a fleet, meeting each other at 12. The fleet forms at target.
The bike starting at 0 (speed 1) does not catch up to any other bike, so it is a fleet by itself.
The bikes starting at 5 (speed 1) and 3 (speed 3) become a fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

Example 2:
Input: target = 10, position = [3], speed = [3]
Output: 1
Explanation:
There is only one bike, hence there is only one fleet.

Example 3:
Input: target = 100, position = [0,2,4], speed = [4,2,1]
Output: 1
Explanation:
The bikes starting at 0 (speed 4) and 2 (speed 2) become a fleet, meeting each other at 4. The bike starting at 4 (speed 1) travels to 5.
Then, the fleet at 4 (speed 2) and the bike at position 5 (speed 1) become one fleet, meeting each other at 6. The fleet moves at speed 1 until it reaches target.

The answer and all the intermediate calculations can be represented in a 32-bit integer.
 
Example 1:
Input: tokens = ["2","1","+","3","*"]
Output: 9
Explanation: ((2 + 1) * 3) = 9

Example 2:
Input: tokens = ["4","13","5","/","+"]
Output: 6
Explanation: (4 + (13 / 5)) = 6

Example 3:
Input: tokens = ["10","6","9","3","+","-11","*","/","*","17","+","5","+"]
Output: 22
Explanation: ((10 * (6 / ((9 + 3) * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / (12 * -11))) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * (6 / -132)) + 17) + 5
= ((10 * 0) + 17) + 5
= (0 + 17) + 5
= 17 + 5
= 22

Day 9:
1. First Non-Repeating Character in a Stream
For a given stream of lowercase letters, output the first non-repeating character after each input character.
In many real-time systems, it is important to track the first non-repeating character from a stream of characters.
You are given a string s, which represents a stream of lowercase English letters.
Your task is to output a new string where each character at position i represents the first non-repeating character in the stream up to the ith character. If there is no such character, append #.

Input Format:
A single line containing a string s consisting of lowercase English letters.

s contains only lowercase English letters.

Output Format:
A single string of length equal to s, where each character represents the first non-repeating character in the stream up to that point or # if none exists.

2. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch
The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.

Example 1:
Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0 
Explanation:
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
- Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
- Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].
Hence all students are able to eat.

Example 2:
Input: students = [1,1,1,0,0,1], sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
Output: 3

3. Minimum Sum of Values by Dividing Array
You are given two arrays nums and andValues of length n and m respectively.
The value of an array is equal to the last element of that array.
You have to divide nums into m disjoint contiguous subarrays such that for the ith subarray [li, ri], the bitwise AND of the subarray elements is equal to andValues[i], in other words, nums[li] & nums[li + 1] & ... & nums[ri] == andValues[i] for all 1 <= i <= m, where & represents the bitwise AND operator.
Return the minimum possible sum of the values of the m subarrays nums is divided into. If it is not possible to divide nums into m subarrays satisfying these conditions, return -1.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,4,3,3,2], andValues = [0,3,3,2]
Output: 12
Explanation:
The only possible way to divide nums is:
[1,4] as 1 & 4 == 0.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[3] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
[2] as the bitwise AND of a single element subarray is that element itself.
The sum of the values for these subarrays is 4 + 3 + 3 + 2 = 12.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,7,7,5], andValues = [0,7,5]
Output: 17
Explanation:
There are three ways to divide nums:
[[2,3,5],[7,7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 5 + 7 + 5 == 17.
[[2,3,5,7],[7,7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.
[[2,3,5,7,7],[7],[5]] with the sum of the values 7 + 7 + 5 == 19.
The minimum possible sum of the values is 17.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], andValues = [2]
Output: -1

Explanation:
The bitwise AND of the entire array nums is 0. As there is no possible way to divide nums into a single subarray to have the bitwise AND of elements 2, return -1

Constraints:
1 <= n == nums.length <= 104
1 <= m == andValues.length <= min(n, 10)
1 <= nums[i] < 105
0 <= andValues[j] < 105





4. There are a number of plants in a garden. Each of the plants has been treated with some amount of pesticide. After each day, if any plant has more pesticide than the plant on its left, being weaker than the left one, it dies.
You are given the initial values of the pesticide in each of the plants. Determine the number of days after which no plant dies, i.e. the time after which there is no plant with more pesticide content than the plant to its left.
pesticide levels
Use a -indexed array. On day , plants  and  die leaving . On day , plant  in  dies leaving . There is no plant with a higher concentration of pesticide than the one to its left, so plants stop dying after day .
Function Description
Complete the function poisonousPlants in the editor below.
poisonousPlants has the following parameter(s):
int p[n]: the pesticide levels in each plant

Returns
- int: the number of days until plants no longer die from pesticide

Input Format
The first line contains an integer , the size of the array .
The next line contains  space-separated integers .

Sample Input
		7
		6 5 8 4 7 10 9
		Sample Output
		2
		Explanation
Initially all plants are alive.
Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (8,3), (4,4), (7,5), (10,6), (9,7)}
Plants[k] = (i,j) => jth plant has pesticide amount = i.
After the 1st day, 4 plants remain as plants 3, 5, and 6 die.
Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,4), (9,7)}
After the 2nd day, 3 plants survive as plant 7 dies.
Plants = {(6,1), (5,2), (4,4)}
Plants stop dying after the 2nd day.




5. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports
You have the task of delivering some boxes from storage to their ports using only one ship. However, this ship has a limit on the number of boxes and the total weight that it can carry.
You are given an array boxes, where boxes[i] = [ports​​i​, weighti], and three integers portsCount, maxBoxes, and maxWeight.
ports​​i is the port where you need to deliver the ith box and weightsi is the weight of the ith box.
portsCount is the number of ports.
maxBoxes and maxWeight are the respective box and weight limits of the ship.
The boxes need to be delivered in the order they are given. The ship will follow these steps:
The ship will take some number of boxes from the boxes queue, not violating the maxBoxes and maxWeight constraints.
For each loaded box in order, the ship will make a trip to the port the box needs to be delivered to and deliver it. If the ship is already at the correct port, no trip is needed, and the box can immediately be delivered.
The ship then makes a return trip to storage to take more boxes from the queue.
The ship must end at storage after all the boxes have been delivered.
Return the minimum number of trips the ship needs to make to deliver all boxes to their respective ports.

Example 1:
Input: boxes = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,1]], portsCount = 2, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes all the boxes in the queue, goes to port 1, then port 2, then port 1 again, then returns to storage. 4 trips.
So the total number of trips is 4.
Note that the first and third boxes cannot be delivered together because the boxes need to be delivered in order (i.e. the second box needs to be delivered at port 2 before the third box).

Example 2:
Input: boxes = [[1,2],[3,3],[3,1],[3,1],[2,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 3, maxWeight = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows: 
- The ship takes the first box, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the second, third and fourth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth box, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

Example 3:
Input: boxes = [[1,4],[1,2],[2,1],[2,1],[3,2],[3,4]], portsCount = 3, maxBoxes = 6, maxWeight = 7
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal strategy is as follows:
- The ship takes the first and second boxes, goes to port 1, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the third and fourth boxes, goes to port 2, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
- The ship takes the fifth and sixth boxes, goes to port 3, then returns to storage. 2 trips.
So the total number of trips is 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.
 
Constraints:
1 <= boxes.length <= 105
1 <= portsCount, maxBoxes, maxWeight <= 105
1 <= ports​​i <= portsCount
1 <= weightsi <= maxWeight

6. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order
You are given an integer array deck. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the ith card is deck[i].
You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.
You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:
Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
If there are still cards in the deck then put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
If there are still unrevealed cards, go back to step 1. Otherwise, stop.
Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.
Note that the first entry in the answer is considered to be the top of the deck.

Example 1:
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this order does not matter), and reorder it.
After reordering, the deck starts as [2,13,3,11,5,17,7], where 2 is the top of the deck.
We reveal 2, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [3,11,5,17,7,13].
We reveal 3, and move 11 to the bottom.  The deck is now [5,17,7,13,11].
We reveal 5, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [7,13,11,17].
We reveal 7, and move 13 to the bottom.  The deck is now [11,17,13].
We reveal 11, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [13,17].
We reveal 13, and move 17 to the bottom.  The deck is now [17].
We reveal 17.
Since all the cards revealed are in increasing order, the answer is correct.

Example 2:
Input: deck = [1,1000]
Output: [1,1000]

Constraints:
1 <= deck.length <= 1000
1 <= deck[i] <= 106
All the values of deck are unique.



Day 10:
1. Dota2 Senate
In the world of Dota2, there are two parties: the Radiant and the Dire.
The Dota2 senate consists of senators coming from two parties. Now the Senate wants to decide on a change in the Dota2 game. The voting for this change is a round-based procedure. In each round, each 

senator can exercise one of the two rights:
Ban one senator's right: A senator can make another senator lose all his rights in this and all the following rounds.
Announce the victory: If this senator found the senators who still have rights to vote are all from the same party, he can announce the victory and decide on the change in the game.

Given a string senate representing each senator's party belonging. The character 'R' and 'D' represent the Radiant party and the Dire party. Then if there are n senators, the size of the given string will be n.
The round-based procedure starts from the first senator to the last senator in the given order. This procedure will last until the end of voting. All the senators who have lost their rights will be skipped during the procedure.
Suppose every senator is smart enough and will play the best strategy for his own party. 

Predict which party will finally announce the victory and change the Dota2 game. The output should be "Radiant" or "Dire".

Example 1:
Input: senate = "RD"
Output: "Radiant"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And in round 2, the first senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Example 2:
Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator comes from Radiant and he can just ban the next senator's right in round 1. 
And the second senator can't exercise any rights anymore since his right has been banned. 
And the third senator comes from Dire and he can ban the first senator's right in round 1. 
And in round 2, the third senator can just announce the victory since he is the only guy in the senate who can vote.

Constraints:
n == senate.length
1 <= n <= 104
senate[i] is either 'R' or 'D'.


2. Reverse Nodes in k-Group, Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list k at a time, and return the modified list.

k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes, in the end, should remain as it is.
You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

Example 1:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]

Example 2:
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]


3. Minimum Window Substring
User Behavior Analysis on E-commerce Platform
An e-commerce platform tracks user activities like "search product," "add to cart," and "checkout." To optimize user journeys, analysts want to find the shortest sequence containing all these events.

Problem Statement:
Given a list of user activities, find the smallest window containing all key actions.

Example:
Input:
activities = ["browse", "search product", "add to cart", "checkout", "feedback"]  
required_actions = ["search product", "checkout"]
Output:
["search product", "add to cart", "checkout"]


4. Sliding Window Maximum
Heart Rate Monitoring in Healthcare:
A wearable health device monitors a user's heart rate during exercise. To provide health insights, the device must track the highest heart rate over every 1-minute interval.
Problem Statement: Given an array heartRates[] and an integer k, find the maximum heart rate for each sliding window of size k.
Input1:
heartRates = [72, 80, 75, 90, 85, 92, 88]
k = 3
Output1:
Maximum heart rates for each sliding window:
[80, 90, 90, 92, 92]

heartRates = [70, 85, 60, 95, 82, 74, 90]
k = 2
Maximum heart rates for each sliding window:
[85, 85, 95, 95, 82, 90]
Window [70, 85] → max = 85
Window [85, 60] → max = 85
Window [60, 95] → max = 95
Window [95, 82] → max = 95
Window [82, 74] → max = 82
Window [74, 90] → max = 90


5. Longest Repeating Character Replacement
You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.
Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

Example 1:
Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

Example 2:
Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.
There may exists other ways to achieve this answer too.

Constraints:
1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of only uppercase English letters.
0 <= k <= s.length
